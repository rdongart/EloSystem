Use the SE Elo System GUI for creating a database of Elo ratings of starcraft players.

You can also download a database (.elo and .res files) from the following link:
https://app.box.com/s/7dmn2qbx6dgnuq40orar1znr1pkjfnrg

Place .elo and .res files in the folder named EloSystems and open them from within the SCElo.exe program.

Files with .elo extension is the database file.
Files with .res extension is a file containing resources (primarily images) to supplement the database content. 

Files (.elo and .res) must have identical names in order for the GUI to be able to treat them as connected.
